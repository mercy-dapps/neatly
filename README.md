# neatly

A clean, fast CLI tool that organises files in a directory by sorting them into subfolders based on their file type. Built with Rust.

```

└── code/
    └── script.py
```

## Features

- **Preview** — see exactly what would happen before any files are moved
- **Organise** — sort files into subfolders by type with a single command
- **Undo** — restore everything back to its original location and remove the created folders

## Usage

### Preview
See what would happen without moving any files:
```bash
neatly preview ~/Downloads
```

Example output:
```
Preview - no files will be moved:

 invoice.pdf -> documents/
 photo.jpg -> images/
 song.mp3 -> audio/
 script.py -> code/

4 file(s) would be moved.
```

### Organise
Sort files into subfolders:
```bash
neatly run ~/Downloads
```

Example output:
```
 invoice.pdf -> documents/
 photo.jpg -> images/
 song.mp3 -> audio/
 script.py -> code/

4 file(s) organised.
```

### Undo
Restore all files to their original location and remove the created folders:
```bash
neatly undo ~/Downloads
```

Example output:
```
 Restored: /Users/mac/Downloads/invoice.pdf
 Restored: /Users/mac/Downloads/photo.jpg
 Restored: /Users/mac/Downloads/song.mp3
 Restored: /Users/mac/Downloads/script.py

4 file(s) restored.
```

## Recommended Workflow

Always run `preview` before `run` to confirm the output looks right:

```bash
# 1. Check what will happen
neatly preview ~/Desktop

# 2. Organise
neatly run ~/Desktop

# 3. Made a mistake? Undo it
neatly undo ~/Desktop
```

---

## How it works

- `neatly run` moves files and writes a `.neatly_log.json` file to the target directory, recording every move
- `neatly undo` reads the log, reverses every move, deletes empty folders, and removes the log file
- Hidden files (starting with `.`) are always skipped
- Subdirectories are never touched
